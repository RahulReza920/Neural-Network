# Neural Networks Algorithms Implementation in Python

This repository contains five popular neural networks algorithms implementation in python. Among them, 3 are supervised and 2 are unsupervised Not only that but also it contains the proper documentation of each algorithm. You can find out the documentation inside the corresponding folder. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Rizoan Toufiq sir, Assistant Professor, Dept. of CSE, RUET for the guidelines.

The algorithms implemented are:

1.Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
2.Perceptron Learning Algorithm
3.Back Propagation Algorithm
4.Kohonen Network Algorithm
5.Hopfield Network Algorithm
