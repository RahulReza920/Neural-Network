# Neural Networks Algorithms Implementation in Python

This repository contains five popular neural networks algorithms implementation in python. Among them, 3 are supervised and 2 are unsupervised Not only that but also it contains the proper documentation of each algorithm. You can find out the documentation inside the corresponding folder. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Rizoan Toufiq sir, Assistant Professor, Dept. of CSE, RUET for the guidelines.

The algorithms implemented are:

Nearest Neighbor Algorithm
Perceptron Learning Algorithm
Back Propagation Algorithm
Kohonen Network Algorithm
Hopfield Network Algorithm
